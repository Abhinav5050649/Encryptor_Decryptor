# Encryptor Decryptor Project

This is an Exploratory Project with the help of which I got to experience Cryptography
edf.py == File Encryptor Decryptor via CLI

##  About the Project

As of now, the project consists of a Python Program, which helps implement: -

1) In Encryption: -
    a) Morse Code
    b) SHA256(Using hashlib)
    c) RSA(Using RSA Module/Library of Python)
    d) Fernet(Using the Cryptography Module/Library of Python)

2) In Decryption: -
    a) Morse Code
    b) RSA(Using RSA Module of Python)
    c) Fernet(Using the Cryptography Module of Python)

## Requirements

1) One should have a device capable of running python programs, and a terminal to run it on
2) Ensure that your system has the: -
    a) RSA
    b) hashlib
    c) cryptography

    Modules of Python installed

## Final Note

The program should work well. Do feel free to let me know if you face any issues.

I have added the text documents for the conversion of English to Morse Code and vice-versa and python files 
containing the dictionaries used for the same.

Thanks :)
